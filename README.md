Hello I am Soorya Sivaganesan. I am a freshman at NYU Stern School of Business.
During my class registration, I found it extremelly difficult to make different class schdeules manually. Lot of my batchmates had the same problem.

To tackle this, I came up with an automated class scheduling program using python which can generate multiple class schedules given the required information in just a FEW SECONDS !!
This project is particularly meant for NYU classes. Hope you find it useful. Ciao
